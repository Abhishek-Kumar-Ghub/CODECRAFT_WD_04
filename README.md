Welcome to my developer portfolio!
I'm Abhishek Kumar, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student with hands-on experience in frontend and full-stack development, hackathons, community building, and leadership.

This portfolio features a collection of my personal and collaborative projects, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. From dynamic websites to interactive UIs, each project reflects my passion for clean code, user-friendly design, and real-world problem solving.
